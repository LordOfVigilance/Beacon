# Beacon
Fourth Year Capstone Project for Software Engineering at the University of Western Ontario
This is an idea for a adventure exploration game in which you play as a wave moving through a world after an event. 
The goal is to move through this world visiting Beacons and uncovering sound artifacts from a time long past.
This project is no longer being updated by the creators
